React-Youtube

Its my first project as I started learning React. Its a part of the course React-Redux on Udemy, taught by Stephen Grider.

It uses the Yoututbe API to fetch data, and React.js to render it on the broswer.
Its cool because its slightly faster than youtube, as *only* the searched videos are fetched by the brower.

To get started with this project to contribute :
```
> git clone https://github.com/eoo/react-youtube.git
> cd react-youtube
> npm install
> npm start
